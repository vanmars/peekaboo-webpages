#### By _**Vanessa Stewart, Alex Goodwin, and Joseph Karnafel**_

## Description

_This repo contains two webpages built to practice hiding and showing HTML elements with jQuery effects. 'index.html' hides and shows images while 'webpage.html' hides and shows text._

## Known Bugs

_As the intent of the project was to practice JavaScript/jQuery, the styling leaves much to be desired._

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS/Bootstrap
* JavaScript/jQuery
